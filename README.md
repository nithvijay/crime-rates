# Dash with Analysis of Crime Rates

[Check out the website!](http://crime-rates-dash.herokuapp.com/)

This project was done to learn Dash. Dash is a open-source Python library, that I wanted to experiment with as a easy, interactive way to showcase my data science projects in a website format. The content of the website is a basic analysis project about crime data in NYC, which is presented using Plotly.

The `DataEngineering.ipynb` contains much of the analysis. The files were too large to be put on Github, so I had to keep the files locally and upload smaller, post-engineered datasets. Because of this, the original files are not in the repository. The website is hosted by Heroku; the `app.py` file contains the bulk of the website itself. `DashApp.ipynb` is a development file that was used in JupyterLab that also contains the website.
