# Dash with Analysis of Crime Rates

I mainly started this project as a way to create a running website with Dash. I had ideas that Dash would be useful in showcasing any projects in an interactive way, so I wanted to do basic analysis and see how easy it was to create a Dash app with it.

[The website is here](http://crime-rates-dash.herokuapp.com/)

The `DataEngineering.ipynb` contains much of the analysis. The files were too large to be put on Github, so I had to keep the files locally and upload smaller, post-engineered datasets. The original files are not in the repository. The `app.py` file is the file that is hosted by Heroku. `DashApp.ipynb` is a development file that was used in JupyterLab. The Dash extension made it very easy to update the website immediately and allowed for easy bug fixing.
