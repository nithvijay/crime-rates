    "            ### Introduction\n",
    "            Have you ever been scared robbed in public when the stock market was looking like a droopy red twizzler? Or have you ever been scared of being beat up in an alley when the temperature was between 40-50 degrees? Well fear no more as we decided to use our knowledge of data science to alleviate these fears and provide everyone the knowledge of what economic and weather settings are safest to leave the warm and cozy home. We used three time series data sets of New York City from around 2005-2016 and graphed them against each other to find any correlations between weather and crime or economic downturns and crime. Using the coordinate data provided in the crime dataset we were also able to map the crime out on the various boroughs of New York to find concentrations of crime over time. While this does not provide a thorough answer as to when it is safest to leave your home, it does provide an interesting and new insight to think about before daring to wander about the wild outdoors.\n",
